# SpriteKitCookbook
This is my SpriteKit Cookbook written in Swift 2. 
This is a growing collection of code snippets help me make a game for IOS or TVOS.
HOW TO USE: First pick the snippet best suited to your needs by title/file. Example: ShapeNode. Then open the file to view the code example. Copy and paste into your own project to test or use.
NOTE: since there are several ways of using code there maybe more then one code snippet for the same job.
I will NOT reasponsible for these snippets working expected in your project. This is only a helpful guide. 
Be warned these are the bare mimimuim examples to get up and running as fast as possible. 
Putting them all together without bugs is another trick in it's self. 
If you have used this Cookbook and it helped you please consider adding a few of your own and passing them on.
ENJOY!
